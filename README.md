# The _C. elegans_ Observatory

The _C. elegans_ Observatory (also "Observatory" or "Worm Observatory") is a suite of hardware and software that
enables high throughput monitoring of the behavior of _C. elegans_ as they age.  This repository is intended to
hold the most up-to-date version of the software, hardware, and documentation that has been vetted for correctness
and usability.  (Development may or may not occur directly as branches.)

## What is _C. elegans_ and why observe it?

_Caenorhabditis elegans_ is a 1 mm long soil-dwelling nematode used as one of the primary experimental organisms
in biological research.  It is particularly useful for studying aging because its lifespan is normally around three
weeks, which enables researchers to conduct many sequential experiments before they themselves die of old age.

There is more to life than simply being not dead yet, however.  Although measuring lifespan is straightforward and
many insights into aging, both in worms and other animals, have been gained for it, worms like other organisms also
show a long process of declining ability throughout their lives.  Observing and quantifying this decline allows us
to explore the biology of maintaining and losing youthful vigor, something which is potentially of great interest
to people who are old or will perhaps become so someday.

## Why isn't there anything here?

This repository is currently primarily a placeholder.  A paper describing the _C. elegans_ Observatory is under
review and will be linked here when it is published.  Furthermore, a snapshot of the code and designs as of
publication will be available on Zenodo, and will also be linked here when made available.

The primary reason why this repository is empty, however, is that the Observatory was created iteratively in
an exploratory fashion.  Although one instance of it exists, it is somewhat idiosyncratic at this point.  This
repository is intended to contain instructions and code for a _canonical_ version of the Observatory which can
potentially be built and run by other labs (or the original creators).  However, as of this writing, such a
canonical version does not exist.  Therefore, this repository is essentially empty.  As this changes, the
repository will be updated and this note will be updated to reflect the current state of affairs.
